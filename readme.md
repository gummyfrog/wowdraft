TODO:

1. Tidy all VUE components, rename variables to be less confusing
2. Move VUE components to their own file for reuse
3. Move API calls to a separate router, put most behind authentication wall
4. Move user accounts away from discord
5. Clean Style.css, make a real, actual font stack
6. Better Mobile Styling 
7. Rankings! That's the important part!
